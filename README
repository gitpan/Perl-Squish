NAME
    Perl::Squish - Reduce Perl code to a few characters as possible

DESCRIPTION
    Perl source code can often be quite large, with copious amounts of
    comments, inline POD documentation, and inline tests and other padding.

    The actual code can represent as little as 10-20% of the content of
    well-written modules.

    In situations where the Perl files need to be included, but do not need
    to be readable, this module will "squish" them. That is, it will strip
    out as many characters as it can from the source, while leaving the
    function of the code identical to the original.

METHODS
    "Perl::Squish" is a fully PPI::Transform-compatible class. See that
    module's documentation for more information.

TO DO
    To keep things simple for the talk, I really don't get into some of the
    more in depth stuff that could make things even smaller.

SUPPORT
    Bugs should always be submitted via the CPAN bug tracker, located at

    <http://rt.cpan.org/NoAuth/ReportBug.html?Queue=Perl-Squish>

    For general comments, contact the author.
