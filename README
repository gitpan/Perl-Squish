NAME
    Perl::Squish - Reduce Perl code to a few characters as possible

DESCRIPTION
    Perl source code can often be quite large, with copious amounts of
    comments, inline POD documentation, and inline tests and other padding.

    The actual code can represent as little as 10-20% of the content of
    well-written modules.

    In situations where the Perl files need to be included, but do not need
    to be readable, this module will "squish" them. That is, it will strip
    out as many characters as it can from the source, while leaving the
    function of the code identical to the original.

METHODS
  file $filename [, $output ]
    The "file" method squishes a Perl document by filename. If passed a
    single parameter, it modifies the file in-place. If provided a second
    parameter, it will attempt to save the squished file to the alternative
    filename.

    Returns true on success, or "undef" on error.

  document $Document
    The "document" method takes a PPI::Document object, and modifies it
    directly.

    Returns the document object as a convenience, or "undef" on error.
